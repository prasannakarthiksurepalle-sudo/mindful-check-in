# Welcome to my  project

## Project info

Mind Track is a simple prototype mental health application focused on analyzing user stress through text input. In its current form, the app presents a window where users can describe their thoughts or feelings, and the system analyzes this input to estimate stress levels and provide basic suggestions to improve well-being. While planned features such as scheduled mood check-ins, notifications, and long-term mood tracking are not yet implemented, this project serves as a working model to explore stress analysis and mental health insights. Future updates aim to expand functionality and introduce more advanced tracking and lifestyle-based recommendations.
