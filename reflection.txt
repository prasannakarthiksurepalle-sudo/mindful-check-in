I made this project using lovable.dev . I wanna create something which helps in treating our mental health in a app, there are many bots present but there isn't any dedicated app to look after our mental health, it is as important as our physical health. I had an idea and developed used the Lovable tool, it is a great tool for developers to develop a MVP application with a single prompt. I learnt how to create real world applications using AI, it's great to deploy it. This is just a simple MVP app, we can add many features later and can turn  it into a full scale application, integrating AI analysis, real time checking through notifications and  much more. Thank you for reading this.
